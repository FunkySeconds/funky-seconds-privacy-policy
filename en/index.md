# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: May 15, 2025*

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the independent developer ("we," "us," "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the Funky Seconds mobile application ("the Game"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide

When you use the Game, we do not require you to create an account or provide personal information. You may choose to input player names and create custom game cards, which are stored locally on your device.

### 2.2 Information Collected Automatically

The Game collects and stores game-related data locally on your device, such as:

- Team configurations
- Game settings and preferences
- Custom cards you create
- Game progress and statistics
- Card usage tracking for enhancing gameplay

## 3. Web Search Functionality

### 3.1 Card Search Feature

The Game includes a feature that allows you to search for card words using external web search engines. When you use this feature:

- The Game opens your device's default web browser
- The search query (card word) is sent to the external search engine
- We do not track, store, or have access to your search activity
- Your interaction with the external search engine is subject to their privacy policy

### 3.2 External Services

When using the web search functionality, you will be redirected to external websites. These websites have their own privacy policies and data collection practices that are beyond our control. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these external services before using them.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

All data in the Game is processed and stored entirely on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or have access to any of this information. Your device uses this locally stored information to:

- Save your game progress and preferences
- Track card usage to enhance your gameplay experience
- Manage team configurations and game settings
- Store custom cards you create

## 5. Detailed Data Storage Information

### 5.1 Local Storage Only

All data collected by the Game is stored exclusively on your device using standard device storage mechanisms. We do not transmit or store your data on external servers. This local-only approach means:

- Your data remains on your device at all times
- We cannot access your data remotely
- Your data is not shared with third parties by the Game
- Uninstalling the Game will permanently delete all stored data

### 5.2 Storage Mechanisms

The Game uses the following storage mechanisms:

- SharedPreferences: For storing game settings, player progress, and preferences
- Local device storage: For storing custom cards and game state information
- Card usage tracking: Stored locally to improve card distribution in future games

### 5.3 Data Backup

The Game does not provide built-in backup functionality. Data may be included in device-level backups if enabled by your device settings. Restoring your device from a backup may restore Game data, but we cannot guarantee this functionality as it depends on your device's backup system.

### 5.4 Data Security Limitations

While the Game uses standard data storage practices, as a solo developer project, there are limitations to the security measures in place. No method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data. You use the Game at your own risk.

## 6. No Data Sharing or Third-Party Services

The Game does not use any third-party analytics, crash reporting, or tracking services. We do not collect or share any of your information with third parties. The only external functionality used is:

- The URL launcher service provided by your device's operating system when you choose to search for a card word online
- This URL launcher simply opens your device's web browser with a search query
- No data from this interaction is returned to the Game or to us

## 7. Children's Privacy

The Game is not directed to children under the age of 13. The Game does not intentionally collect personal information from children under 13. Please note that as a mobile application, the developer cannot remotely delete the app from users' devices or remove data stored locally on devices. Parents or guardians are responsible for monitoring their children's device usage and managing app installations.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the Game. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 9. Feedback and Questions

As an independent app developed by a solo developer, there is currently no dedicated support channel or contact information available. Any important updates to this Privacy Policy will be communicated through updates to the app.

## 10. Consent

By using the Game, you consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms and conditions.

## 11. Your Rights and Controls

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data. You can:

- Reset game settings through the in-game options
- Clear custom cards and discard pile through the deck management screens
- Completely remove all data by uninstalling the application
